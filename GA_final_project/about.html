			<h1>About Film Hunter</h1>
				<p>Film Hunter makes it easy to find the best movie playing near you, right now.</p>
		</div>

			<h2>How Does It Work?</h2>

			<h3>Ratings</h3>
				<p>Film Hunter assumes you want to see a good movie, so it only returns movies critics rated 80% or higher on rotten tomatoes. Click on the movie title to check out their ratings in more detail.</p>
			<h3>Location</h3>
				<p>Right now, Film Hunter is city-centic. It uses your current location and returns results within a one mile radius.</p>
			<h3>Timing</h3>
				<p>Film Hunter assumes you want to see a movie soon(ish).</p> 
				<p>"Can't Hardly Wait" shows you movies starting in the next half hour.</p>
				<p>"Coffee and Cigarettes" gives you a little more time - it shows you movies starting in the next hour.</p>
				<p>"Dinner With Andre" shows you starting at most two hours from now.</p>
				<p>And we always start our results 15 minutes before the current time. (If this category had a button, it would be called "There Will Be Previews".)</p>
